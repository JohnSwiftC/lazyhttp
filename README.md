# lazyhttp

An easy library to handle stream objects (TcpStream, TlsStream, etc) transferring HTTP data. Includes a function to parse and return an object representing the request.

> This library does not handle networking or responding. This is really intended to remove a snippet of code that I find myself copying and pasting over and over again.

# Usage

See my crates.io once I publish.
